Visual, In-Expensive Wireless Rheometer (VIEWR)
=====================

Visual, In-Expensive Wireless Rheometer (VIEWR) is a low-cost (approx. $200), easy-to-deploy and versatile rheological measurement system. It is designed to measure the rheological behavior of materials and fluids in real-time, with high accuracy and precision. VIEWR is a wireless rheometer that can be used for a wide range of applications, including transient and steady shear flow characterization (viscosity and relaxation time), particle image velocimetry (PIV), extensional rheology (access to a delicate SLA or DMD printing facility required). The capability of in-situ observation allows for real-time measurement of the flow-structure interaction (FSI). VIEWR can be used for long-term flow study of complex biological systems, such as cells, tissues and bioinks under stringent conditions, such as in an incubator or in a biosafety cabinet. VIEWR is manufactured from off-the-shelf and 3D printed components, and can be easily replicated to constitute a high-throughput measurement assay.

This repository hosts the up-to-date commits for Visual, In-Expensive Wireless Rheometer (VIEWR) with bug fixing and added features. Refer to the Wiki page for detailed instructions and specifications. 

The old repistory is located on [OSF](https://osf.io/wj62b/) with necessary files and instructions for the VIEWR in publication[^1], but is in the process of deprecation.
